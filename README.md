Starting with a machine from china is a very good way to start this business venture in the wrong foot.

No support, no parts availability. Service techs like myself charge more for machines imported as most of the time itâ€™s a huge clusterfuck as to what is wrong with these machines.

Reconsider.

Go talk to ANY successful vendor in your area thatâ€™s been in business longer than 5 years and ask them if they use/operate any imported machines. I donâ€™t need the answer, I already know what it is ðŸ˜„.

If you still want to go the imported route then go on Alibaba and look up a manufacturer.


 Landing good locations is really hard. Once you do, referrals are a vendor's best friend.
     Restocking is the biggest time sink. It is more than a couple hours  overall for a busy location. Pre-kitting, driving, shopping, filling  machines, restocking unsold inventory to your warehouse, occasional  maintenance, stocking your warehouse, disposing of endless cardboard  boxes, traffic, etc.
     It looks like you are doing your research, but underestimating the  work involved servicing machines. You are carrying liquid, and lots of  it, over and over again.
     The biggest start-up costs are purchasing equipment and getting it  delivered to the locations. Inventory as well. The LLC and filing fees  are not too bad.


     All of mine are 20 minutes away and I stock them 2-3 times a month and it takes maybe 4 hours. I have 16 machines. Pretty much my kind of  passive. If you want to follow my journey, checkout my YouTube:  Fitunicorn007



Having just a few machines/locations is not sustainable in most cases because of spoilage/expiration of unsold inventory. You need a lot of  different locations to move unsold inventory around. Inventory is not  cheap and is the biggest ongoing overhead cost, by far.
